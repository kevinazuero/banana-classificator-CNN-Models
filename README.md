# Banana Ripeness Classification Project

This is a collaborative university project focused on the comparative analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for classifying banana images by ripeness level, using deep learning techniques.

## My Contribution

I was primarily responsible for:

- Developing the training algorithms  
- Building and testing the CNN models  
- Evaluating and comparing model performance

## Project Structure

- **Dataset – Banana Ripeness Classification:**  
  Contains labeled images categorized by ripeness level.

- **Model Training Folders:**  
  - `vgg16_experiments/`, `resnet50_experiments/`, `xception_experiments/`: Training scripts for each CNN architecture  
  - `fine_tuning_experiments/`: Experiments using fine-tuning techniques

- **Results and Outputs:**  
  - `registros/`: CSV files with accuracy, epoch metrics, and test results  
  - `modelos/`: Trained models, organized by architecture  
  - `Matrices de confusión/`: Confusion matrix visualizations

- **Testing and Analysis:**  
  - `imágenes/`: Sample images for inference  
  - `data_analysis/`, `predicciones/`: Scripts for result analysis and prediction
## Documentation

A detailed analysis of the model performances, selection criteria, and evaluation metrics can be found in the `documentation/` archive. This includes all the reasoning behind the final model selection.
